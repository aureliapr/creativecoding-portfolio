There are posters on the walls and various toys scattered about. The room is dark and cold, with thick vines covering the posters on the walls. A large window looks out onto an increasingly unsettling sky. East is the kitchen. You see a small boy named Will sitting on the bed in front of the window.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The window is scenery in the Bedroom. The description of the window is &quot;<span class="quote">The window pane is freezing to the touch, and through it, you can see something is very wrong with the sky. Dark clouds cover the sky. A crimson mist hovers in the distance. Huge white particles hang in the air and smoke-like shapes writhe in the distance.

Will can be greeted or ungreeted. Will is ungreeted. The description of Will is &quot;<span class="quote">A lanky, sensitive child with a distant look in his eyes.

'D&amp;D is like... a way to escape reality, you know? Where monsters aren't real monsters, and you can actually control what happens to you.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dnd/d&amp;d/dungeons/dragons</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'I usually play as the Dungeon Master,' Will admits with a shy smile. 'It lets me create worlds where I'm in control - something I don't always feel in real life. You pick a character, roll some dice, and suddenly you're somewhere else entirely.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">drawing/art/sketching</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Drawing is how I make sense of things,' Will says softly, his fingers unconsciously tracing an imaginary sketch in the air. 'Sometimes words aren't enough, especially when you've seen the things I've seen.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">drawing/art/sketching</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'It helps me process,' Will explains, his voice quiet but intense. 'After everything that's happened, drawing is like... a way to understand the monsters, to make them less scary by putting them on paper.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">upside down/alternate dimension</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'It's not just a place,' Will says, a haunted look crossing his face. 'It's like a nightmare you can't wake up from. Cold, dark, and always watching. Trust me, you don't want to know more.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">upside down/alternate dimension</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'Sometimes the dimensions bleed into each other,' Will whispers, looking over his shoulder. 'And when they do, nothing makes sense anymore. The rules you thought you knew? They don't apply.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">being/feeling different</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'I'm just... different,' Will says with a mix of vulnerability and defiance. 'And that's okay. Different doesn't mean broken. It just means I've seen things others haven't - and survived.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">mike/friendship/friends</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Mike's more than a friend,' Will says softly. 'He's like... family. The kind that stands by you, even when the world seems to be falling apart around you.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">supernatural/weird experiences</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Weird is kind of my normal,' Will says with a wry, slightly tired smile. 'When you've been where I've been, supernatural stops being shocking and starts being just another Tuesday.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hopper/jim</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Hopper's complicated,' Will says thoughtfully. 'He's tough on the outside, but he'd do anything to protect the people he cares about. Especially El. He became more than just a cop - he became a dad.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">angela</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Angela...' Will's face darkens. 'Some people are just cruel for no reason. She made me feel small, different. But I learned that their opinions don't define who I am.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">murray/bauman</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Murray's kind of crazy - but in a smart way,' Will chuckles softly. 'He sees connections others miss. He might seem paranoid, but after everything I've been through, paranoia can keep you alive.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">nancy/wheeler</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Nancy's brave,' Will says with respect. 'She doesn't just sit back when something's wrong. She investigates, she fights. She's the kind of person who turns fear into action.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">jonathan/byers</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Jonathan's my brother,' Will says, a mix of admiration and vulnerability in his voice. 'He's always protected me. Understood me when no one else did. We've been through so much together.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">eleven/el/jane</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'El is... special,' Will explains, a protective tone in his voice. 'She's been through so much, but she's the strongest person I know. Not just because of her powers, but because of her heart.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dustin/henderson</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Dustin? He's like this weird science genius,' Will chuckles softly. 'Always talking about compasses and theories. But he's loyal, you know? When things get weird, he's the first one with a crazy plan that just might work.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">lucas/sinclair</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Lucas is the most practical of us,' Will says with a hint of admiration. 'He thinks things through. Where I get lost in my drawings or my fears, Lucas is always looking for a real solution.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">max/maxine</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Max is tough,' Will says, a smile crossing his face. 'She doesn't take crap from anyone. After everything that happened with Billy, she's had to be strong in ways most people couldn't understand.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">joyce/mom</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'My mom... she never gave up on me,' Will says, his voice cracking slightly. 'Even when everyone else thought I was crazy or lost, she fought. She always fights for her kids.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">supernatural/weird experiences</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Weird is kind of my normal,' Will says with a wry, slightly tired smile. 'When you've been where I've been, supernatural stops being shocking and starts being just another Tuesday.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">trauma/survival</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'You learn to adapt,' Will says quietly. 'Some experiences change you forever. But surviving isn't just about making it out alive. It's about finding hope in the darkest places.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">location/place/here/where we are</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'We're in my house,' Will says nervously, 'but not really. It's like a dark reflection - the Upside Down version. Everything here is wrong, twisted. The air itself feels... hostile.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">location/place/here/where we are</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'This place... it's like a nightmare version of Hawkins,' Will explains, shuddering. 'The same buildings, the same rooms, but everything's cold, dark, and covered in these weird vines. It's like looking at the world through a broken mirror.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">escape/way out/getting out</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'There might be a way,' Will whispers, glancing around. 'Dustin's compass and Lucas's wrist rocket - together they might be strong enough to open a portal. The compass reacts to dimensional gates, and the wrist rocket... well, Lucas modified it in ways even he doesn't understand.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">escape/way out/getting out</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'The living room,' Will says quietly. 'Mom set up those Christmas lights to communicate when I was trapped here. There's usually a weak spot there, where the dimensions are thin. If you can find a way to activate it...'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">portal/gate/tear</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The portal is like a tear between dimensions,' Will explains, his voice tense. 'When it's active, it glows and pulses with this strange energy. But you need something to power it - either special objects or...' he trails off.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">portal/gate/tear</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">Will glances between the ghost trap and the kitchen. 'You'll need tools to open it. Dustin's compass is nearby - it can sense dimensional anomalies. And Lucas left his wrist rocket somewhere in the kitchen. Together they might be enough.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">radio/music</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">Will's eyes widen with recognition. 'That old radio... it's not just for music. Channel 11 especially.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">radio/music</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'The radio has two channels,' Will says hesitantly. 'Channel 5 is usually just static, but 11... that's where strange things happen. If you're brave enough, it might open another way out. '</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">compass/dustin's compass</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Dustin's compass should be in that ghost trap in the living room,' Will says. 'It goes crazy whenever a portal is nearby.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">wrist rocket/slingshot</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Lucas's wrist rocket? Last I saw it, it was on the kitchen counter,' Will recalls. 'He's really protective of it.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">time/hurry/rush</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'You don't have much time,' Will warns urgently. 'The longer you stay here, the stronger its hold becomes. Once the containment protocols activate... that's it. You're trapped like I was.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">vecna/curse/monster</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">Will pales at the mention. 'Vecna is... he gets in your head. Uses your memories against you. But sometimes,' he adds thoughtfully, 'music can be turned against him.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">help/hint/stuck</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'Look,' Will says, leaning forward, 'you have two ways out. Find Dustin's compass and Lucas's wrist rocket - together they can open the portal. Or...' he glances at the radio, 'there's channel 11, but that's risky. Vecna might be listening.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">upside down/escape</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'The Upside Down doesn't like visitors,' Will says grimly. 'It'll try to keep you here, like it did with me. That's why you need to hurry - find the items or risk the radio, but don't let time run out.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">window/sky/view</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The sky...' Will shudders, looking out. 'It's always wrong here. Those particles floating around? We call them spores. And those shapes in the distance... sometimes I draw them, but I try not to look too long.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">window/sky/view</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'The sky looks like that because this place is dying,' Will explains softly. 'Or maybe it was never really alive. The clouds, the red mist... it's like the air itself is toxic. That's why we need to get you out of here.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">toys/games/board games</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">Will glances at the scattered toys with a mix of nostalgia and sadness. 'Those are from before... everything. D&amp;D manuals, my old Castle Byers drawings, some comics Mike and I used to read together. They feel like they're from another lifetime now.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">toys/games/board games</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'The toys are all over my room,' Will says, gesturing around. 'Mom never moved them, even after... you know. I think she wanted everything to stay exactly the same, just in case I came back.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">posters/walls</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Those posters,' Will says, looking at the vine-covered walls, 'they're from movies and comics I loved. The Thing, Star Wars... but here, the vines are slowly consuming them. Like this place is trying to erase who I was.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">posters/walls</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'The vines grow over everything eventually,' Will explains, watching the tendrils creep across his wall decorations. 'They're like the veins of this place. Sometimes I think they're alive, watching us.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">bed/bedroom</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">Will shifts uncomfortably on the bed. 'This room used to be my safe place. Now it's just another reminder of how everything's changed. The bed's always cold here, like it's trying to drain the warmth from you.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">vines/tendrils</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The vines are everywhere,' Will says, his voice dropping to a whisper. 'They're connected to something... bigger. Something that doesn't want us here. They grow, they spread, they consume everything eventually.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">crayons/paper/drawings</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">Will picks up a crayon, turning it over in his hands. 'I used to draw normal things - rockets, knights, adventures. Now I can only draw what I see here. The monsters, the decay, the darkness... it's like my art got infected too.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">sketchbook/drawings</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'My sketchbook...' Will hesitates, clutching it closer. 'It's full of things I've seen here. Things I can't explain in words. Sometimes drawing them is the only way to make sense of it all, even if they give me nightmares.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">castle byers/fort</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">A faint smile crosses Will's face. 'Castle Byers was my fortress. But nothing stays safe here for long. The darkness finds everything eventually.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">room/bedroom/space</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'Everything in here has a shadow version,' Will explains, looking around his room. 'It's like a dark echo of my real bedroom. The same stuff, but twisted, cold, wrong. Even the air feels different - heavier, like it's watching you.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">comics/books</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">Will picks up a mold-covered comic book. 'X-Men, Wizards &amp; Warriors... Mike and I used to read these for hours. Here they're all decaying, like everything else. But sometimes I still look at them, just to remember.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">light/lighting/dark</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'It's always dark here,' Will says, glancing around his dim bedroom. 'Not just normal dark - it's like the darkness is alive, trying to swallow every bit of light. That's why Mom put up those Christmas lights in the living room.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">To respond to the query:</p><p class="indent1">repeat through the Table of Will's Answers:</p><p class="indent2">if the topic understood includes topic entry:</p><p class="indent3">if the current question is the question type entry:</p><p class="indent4">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">reply entry</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent4">rule succeeds;</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 6 - Swearing at Will </p><p class="indent0">Table of Swears</p><p class="indent0">swear_word    </p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">fuck</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">shit</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">bastard</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">bitch</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">asshole</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">damn</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hell</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">crap</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dammit</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">bullshit</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">goddamn</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">frick</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">idiot</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">stupid</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dumb</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">moron</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">jerk</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of asking Will about something:</p><p class="indent1">let current command be &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">the player's command</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; in lower case;</p><p class="indent1">repeat through Table of Swears:</p><p class="indent2">let bad word be &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">swear_word entry</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">if current command matches the text bad word:</p><p class="indent3">say &quot;<span class="quote">A strange, cold smile spreads across Will's face.

His backpack appears to be stuffed with various scientific equipment and at least three D&amp;D sourcebooks.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of greeting Dustin:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">'Hey hey, no need for formalities!' Dustin waves off your greeting with a grin. 'I already gave you the welcome speech when you walked in.

Dustin exclaims, adjusting his cap excitedly. 'It's this amazing tabletop role-playing game where you can be anyone - a powerful wizard, a sneaky rogue, even a totally tubular paladin!

'Then you roll, and boom - the adventure begins!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dice/rolling/d20</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The sacred geometry of chance!' Dustin pulls out a handful of multi-colored dice. 'You've got your d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s, and the holy grail - the d20! Each one's got its own personality.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dice/rolling/d20</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'Listen up because this is crucial,' Dustin says, demonstrating with a flourish. 'You gotta respect the dice. Roll them with confidence, but never - and I mean NEVER - use a dice that's rolled three nat 1s in a row.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dice/rolling/d20</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why do we use dice? Because chaos is beautiful' Dustin exclaims. 'Sometimes you roll a nat 20 and slay the dragon, sometimes you roll a 1 and fall flat on your face. That's what makes it exciting!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">upside down/alternate dimension</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Son of a bitch, you're asking about serious stuff here,' Dustin whispers, leaning in close. 'It's like our world but darker, colder, and way more dangerous. Think of it as a dark reflection - a parallel dimension of our world.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">upside down/alternate dimension</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">Dustin pulls out his compass, handing it to you. 'The electromagnetic field goes totally bonkers when dimensional gates are nearby affecting my trust compass. But seriously, let's hope you never have to find out firsthand!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">science/physics/chemistry</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Science?' Dustin's eyes light up. 'It's like real-world magic, but instead of spells, we've got equations! And instead of wizards, we've got guys like Mr. Clarke. The best teacher by the way!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">science/physics/chemistry</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Because science RULES!' Dustin throws his hands up enthusiastically. 'How else would we understand electromagnetic fields, or build our awesome radio tower, or figure out why compasses go crazy near interdimensional portals?'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dustin/yourself/he</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'I'm Dustin Henderson, master of science, D&amp;D enthusiast extraordinaire, and proud owner of these pearly whites!'

'Some say I'm the brains of the party, but really, I'm just a guy who appreciates a good adventure and the scientific method.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">monsters/creature/demogorgon</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Oh man, oh man, you're asking about some serious stuff here,' Dustin says, voice dropping to a whisper. 'Let's just say there are things out there that would make even the toughest D&amp;D monster look like a baby Yoda. And trust me, I've seen them!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">mews/cat/kitty</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Mews? Oh man, she was the most amazing cat ever!' Dustin's face falls slightly, his voice catching. 'She had this crazy sixth sense about supernatural stuff, always knew when something was off. And, man, she really loved my purringno one else could get it like I could. I miss her so much... It's like the house is just... empty without her.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">mews/cat/kitty</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Mews was more than just a cat, she was a part of the family,' Dustin says quietly, his eyes momentarily distant. 'She had these crazy whiskers that could detect changes in the electromagnetic fieldat least, that's what I thought. I never got the chance to finish my tests on her... It's just not the same without her here, you know? It's like the whole house lost its spark when she... when she passed.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">mike/wheeler</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Mike? He's our Paladin, our fearless leader!' Dustin says proudly. 'Sure, he can be a real pain in the ass sometimes, but he's the heart of the party. Plus, he's got the basement with all our D&amp;D gear. Total campaign master!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">eleven/el/jane</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'El?' Dustin lowers his voice to a whisper. 'She's our real-life mage with psychic powers! And I mean REAL powers, not just role-playing stuff. She can flip vans with her mind! But don't tell anyone I told you that, seriously.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">lucas/sinclair</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Lucas is our party's ranger, and man, can that guy handle a wrist rocket!' Dustin grins. 'He's probably the most level-headed of us all - except when he's arguing with me, which is totally not my fault by the way. But he's always got our backs.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">will/byers</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Will the Wise! He's our cleric and probably the best artist in Hawkins,' Dustin says warmly. 'He's been through some serious shit - sorry, stuff - but he's tougher than anyone gives him credit for. Plus, his D&amp;D campaigns are legendary!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">steve/harrington</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Steve The Hair Harrington?' Dustin grins widely. 'He's like my older brother, man. Started as kind of a douche - sorry, I mean, challenging individual - but now he's the best babysitter in Hawkins. Plus, he's got mad monster-fighting skills with that nail bat!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">max/maxine/mayfield</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Max? She's this totally rad California girl who can skateboard like a boss!' Dustin exclaims. 'She kicked our high scores' asses at the arcade, and she's basically become our party's zoomer. Plus, she puts up with Lucas, which is pretty impressive!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">nancy/wheeler</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Nancy? She's Mike's sister and a total badass!' Dustin says enthusiastically. 'She went from being this straight-A student to someone who can handle a shotgun like a pro. Plus, she's got some serious investigative skills. Like a real-life Barbara Gordon!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">jonathan/byers</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Jonathan is Will's older brother,' Dustin explains. 'He's kind of quiet, but in a cool way, you know? Amazing photographer, and he's got this killer music taste. Plus, he and Nancy make an unstoppable monster-hunting duo!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hopper/jim</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Chief Hopper?' Dustin's eyes widen. 'Sure, he can be scary as hell when he's mad, but he's saved our butts more times than I can count. Plus, he's basically El's dad now, which is pretty awesome.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">joyce/byers</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Mrs. Byers? She's like the most determined mom in the universe!' Dustin says admiringly. 'When something's wrong with Will, she goes full mama bear mode. And let me tell you, NOTHING stops Joyce Byers when she's on a mission. Nothing!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">robin/buckley</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Robin? She used to work with Steve at the ice cream shop, and man, she was something else,' Dustin says, his voice softening. 'She could crack Soviet codes like it was second nature. But what stands out is how close she and Steve werelike real friends. They had each other's backs, no matter what. You dont find that kind of friendship every day.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">eddie/munson</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Eddie? The leader of the Hellfire Club and the most metal D&amp;D master you'll ever meet!' Dustin's voice fills with excitement, but there's a hint of sadness behind it. 'He was this totally rad guitarist, could shred on both an electric guitar AND with a 20-sided die. The guy was a legend! And... he was a hero, too. Eddie went out fighting for all of us, against things no one should ever have to face. He didnt deserve to go like that, but we all owe him everything. Hell always be a legend.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dart/demodog</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Dart?' Dustin's voice gets quiet and a bit sad. 'He was... well, he was kind of my pet demodog. I know, I know, sounds crazy! I found him as a tiny pollywog. I actually thought he was just a weird lizard at first. Turned out to be way more complicated than that...'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dart/demodog</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Son of a bitch, that's a sensitive subject,' Dustin says, adjusting his hat nervously. 'Let's just say he started as a pollywog, grew into what I thought was a baby Demogorgon, but turned out to be what we call a demodog. And yeah, he had a thing for nougat.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">dart/demodog</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why did I keep him?' Dustin sighs deeply. 'Because sometimes you want to believe something dangerous can be good, you know? Plus, he really seemed to like me. In the end, he even remembered our friendship - saved our lives by letting us pass in the tunnels!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">nougat/candy/3musketeers</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Are you kidding me? Only the greatest candy bar ever invented!' Dustin's eyes light up. 'Three Musketeers - pure nougaty goodness wrapped in chocolate. It's not just candy, it's a peace offering that works on both humans AND demodogs!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">nougat/candy/3musketeers</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why is nougat so amazing?' Dustin looks offended at the question. 'First off, it's delicious. Second, it saved our lives once - no joke! And third, have you TRIED nougat? It's like a cloud of happiness covered in chocolate!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">suzie/suzie-poo</span>&quot; who &quot;<span class="quote">'Suzie?' Dustin's face breaks into a huge grin. 'Only the most brilliant girl in all of Utah! We met at science camp - Camp Know Where. She's got an IQ that's off the charts and she knows more about Planck's constant than anyone I've ever met, plus she is hotter than Pheobe Cates!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">suzie/suzie-poo</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'What can I say about Suzie?' Dustin gets a dreamy look. 'She's my girlfriend, though she lives in Utah. Total genius, amazing singer - you should hear our duets! And she can recite more digits of Pi than anyone else at science camp!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">suzie/suzie-poo</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How did we meet?' Dustin straightens his cap proudly. 'At Camp Know Where - it's this super elite science camp. We bonded over our shared love of science, mathematics, and... well, let's just say we have amazing chemistry together!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">radio/walkietalkie/supercom</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'This bad boy?' Dustin proudly holds up his radio. 'It's a Realistic TRC-214, top of the line! With some modifications, this baby can reach frequencies way beyond what Radio Shack intended. Perfect for interdimensional emergencies!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">radio/walkietalkie/supercom</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'The secret is in the setup, my friend,' Dustin explains excitedly. 'You need the right crystals, proper antenna configuration, and enough juice to boost the signal. Plus, you gotta know Planck's constant - trust me, it comes in handy!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">radio/walkietalkie/supercom</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why use radios? Because parents can hear us on our phones, my friend!' Dustin says with a knowing look. 'Plus, when you're dealing with supernatural emergencies, you need reliable and transportable communication.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">batteries/battery</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'We're talking about the lifeblood of all our equipment!' Dustin pulls out a handful. 'Radio Shack's finest - when they're fresh, at least. Nothing worse than dead batteries during a code red situation!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">batteries/battery</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why are batteries so important? Son of a bitch, don't even get me started!' Dustin exclaims. 'Try fighting interdimensional monsters with dead equipment! These babies keep our radios running and our lights shining.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">wrist rocket/slingshot</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, the wrist rocket!' Dustin nods approvingly. 'Lucas's weapon of choice. Simple but effective - we're talking surgical precision here. Sure saved our asses - I mean, saved our butts - more than once!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">wrist rocket/slingshot</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'The key is in the technique,' Dustin demonstrates with an invisible slingshot. 'Lucas has got it down to a science - calculate the trajectory, factor in wind resistance, and BAM! Direct hit! Though maybe don't tell him I was praising his skills.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">compass/compasses</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'These aren't just your ordinary compasses,' Dustin says, tapping one significantly. 'They're our early warning system for supernatural activity. When the electromagnetic field goes wonky, these babies go crazy! It's basically like a poor man's interdimensional detector.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">compass/compasses</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'The needle responds to magnetic fields, right?' Dustin explains, getting into teacher mode. 'So when there's interdimensional activity, the electromagnetic disruption makes them go haywire. Pretty scientific stuff!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">heathkit/ham radio</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The Heathkit?' Dustin's eyes light up. 'Only the most powerful ham radio setup in Hawkins! We're talking about reaching frequencies that would make Radio Shack employees weep. Perfect for reaching my girlfriend in Utah - when she's not grounded, that is.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">heathkit/ham radio</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'First, you need to understand the basics of radio waves,' Dustin starts excitedly. 'Then it's all about finding the right frequency, adjusting for atmospheric conditions, and maybe singing a little NeverEnding Story duet... uh, forget that last part.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cerebro</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'CEREBRO!' Dustin shouts triumphantly. 'My masterpiece of radio engineering! Built it myself at the highest point in Hawkins. This baby can reach all the way to Utah with crystal clear reception. Well, when the weather cooperates, and when certain girlfriends aren't grounded.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cerebro</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'It's all about altitude, power, and precise calibration,' Dustin explains, sketching in the air. 'You need the highest point possible and proper antenna alignment.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">flashlight/lights</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Essential monster-hunting equipment!' Dustin declares, pulling out a flashlight. 'When you're exploring suspicious tunnels or tracking interdimensional creatures, you need reliable illumination. Plus, they're great for sending morse code in emergencies!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">backpack/supplies</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'My emergency kit!' Dustin pats his backpack. 'Always packed with the essentials: compass, radio, spare batteries, emergency snacks - heavy on the nougat.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">paddle ball</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, the paddle ball!' Dustin demonstrates with an invisible one. 'Perfect for testing hand-eye coordination and driving your friends crazy during long stakeouts. Plus, it helps pass the time while waiting for supernatural emergencies!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">escape/way out/getting out</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Listen up because this is crucial,' Dustin leans forward conspiratorially. 'There are two ways out of here. First, my compass and Lucas's wrist rocket together can tear open a portal. Or... there's the radio on channel 11, but that's playing with fire - literally dealing with Vecna himself.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">escape/way out/getting out</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'Okay, here's the deal,' Dustin explains excitedly. 'Option one: find my compass - it's in that ghost trap over there - and Lucas's wrist rocket from the kitchen. Get them both, and BOOM, instant portal! Option two: the radio. Channel 11 might work, but you're basically inviting Vecna into your head. Your choice, but personally, I'd go for the items.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">portal/gate/dimensional tear</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The portal?' Dustin's eyes light up with scientific enthusiasm. 'It's a tear in the fabric of space-time, a bridge between dimensions! When it's active, it glows and pulses with electromagnetic energy. Getting it open though, that's the tricky part.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">portal/gate/dimensional tear</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'There are two ways to activate it,' Dustin explains, counting on his fingers. 'First method: my compass and Lucas's wrist rocket together create enough electromagnetic disruption to force it open. Second method: channel 11 on that radio over there, but that means dealing with Vecna's psychic powers - not exactly ideal!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">time/hurry/rush</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Oh man, oh man,' Dustin checks his watch nervously. 'Listen, once the containment protocols kick in, that's it - you're stuck here forever! The clock's ticking, so either grab my compass and Lucas's wrist rocket, or risk the radio, but do something FAST!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">help/hint/stuck</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'Son of a bitch, you need the crash course?' Dustin adjusts his cap. 'Okay, here's the 411: My compass is in the ghost trap, Lucas's wrist rocket is in the kitchen. Get both, portal opens. Or, tune that radio to channel 11. And whatever you do, don't waste time!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 11 - Alternate Death Pansed by Eleven</p><p class="indent0">To respond to the question:</p><p class="indent1">repeat through the Table of Dustin's Answers:</p><p class="indent2">if the topic understood includes topic entry:</p><p class="indent3">if the current question is the question type entry:</p><p class="indent4">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">reply entry</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent4">rule succeeds;</p><p class="indent1">increment the stump-counter;</p><p class="indent1">if the stump-counter is 1:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">Dustin scratches his head: 'Son of a bitch, that's a tough one!
